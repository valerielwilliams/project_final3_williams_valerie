# Resources
I'd like to thank the following people for providing me the tools, knowledge and plugins needed to complete this project:

* Josh Pope for creating the [SlickNav](http://www.slicknav.com/) hamburger menu jQuery plugin that I used for my navigation menu when my website is viewed on mobile devices. 
* Claudia Romano and the folks at CodyHouse.co for creating a ["back to top" jQuery plugin](https://codyhouse.co/gem/back-to-top/) that I used to smoothly return the user to the top of the page after they've scrolled through the page content.
* Jan Sorgalla for developing [Lity](http://sorgalla.com/lity/), a jQuery lightbox plugin that I used to play a YouTube video on my website.
* The folks at w3schools.com for providing me with this [jQuery code](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_eff_animate_smoothscroll) that I used to provide visitors with smooth scrolling throughout my website from the navigation menu.
* The geniuses at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/883448/is-there-a-way-to-grow-shrink-an-image-on-hover-using-jquery) for helping me figure out how to shrink the logo image on hover by using jQuery.
* The GitHub Help team for writing this [article](https://help.github.com/articles/renaming-a-repository/) on how to rename a repository.
* Nick! He was awesome and was available over the entire holiday weekend to help with any question I had about my project. He suggested most of the plugins mentioned above, and gave me help whenever I got stuck. He was particularly helpful getting the Bob's Burgers logo added to the hamburger menu plugin, which really helped with the look and feel of the website. Thank you so much, Nick!

# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
This project was a lot of fun. The Burger of the Day section was probably the most difficult section to format because of the background and the title length. There are probably better ways that I could've handed the formatting of the menu items and prices, so I'd like some feedback on that.  Thanks!
